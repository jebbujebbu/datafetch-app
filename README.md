# DataFetch App

An Android app that fetches and displays date-name data from a JSON source, demonstrating networking, JSON parsing, and list UI display using both ListView and RecyclerView.

## Features

- Fetches JSON data from a hosted file via GitHub Pages
- Parses JSON array containing dates and names
- Displays data in a list using:
  - Original ListView with a custom adapter
  - Modern RecyclerView with an updated adapter
- Demonstrates networking with Volley library
- Supports edge-to-edge display with padding for system bars

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jebbujebbu/datafetch-app.git
cd datafetch-app
```

2. Open either the ``/app`` folder (original ListView version) or the ``/app-recyclerview`` folder (RecyclerView version) in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

## Usage

The app automatically fetches data from: `https://jebbujebbu.github.io/datafetch-app/data/data.json`.

Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings to serve this JSON file publicly.

## Project Structure

- ``/app``
  Original Android app using ListView.
  This version is my original implementation showcasing basic Android list handling and networking.

- ``/app-recyclerview``
  Enhanced app refactored to use RecyclerView for a modern list UI.
  This demonstrates updated Android development practices with minimal changes from the original code.

- ``/data/data.json``
  JSON data file hosted on GitHub Pages, used as the appâ€™s data source.

## Example JSON Data Format

```json
[
  {
    "pvm": "27.5.2017 12:15:30",
    "nimi": "Matt Damon"
  },
  {
    "pvm": "28.5.2017 08:00:00",
    "nimi": "Emma Watson"
  }
]
```
